## What is it?

What Do You Do? (abbr. WDYD) is a tool to help share your work items with others periodically and publically.

## How it works?

Simple!
People document their work items throughout the week (in free form) in the `SUMMARY.md` file, and the result is tagged/released on GitHub and published to Zulip automatically.
Afterward, a fresh summary file is commited.

    users((Users)) -- Write ------> summary[Summary file]

    prepare -- Read --> summary

    prepare ==> publish[[Publish]]
    publish --> zulip[Zulip message] & release[GitHub Release]

    publish ===> finalize[[Finalize]]
    finalize -- Delete --> summary
```

Thereâ€™s also a scheduled reminder to add the work items.

```

## Repository set-up

The following configuration is required for the tool to function.

### Variables

Define these [variables](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/variables):
- `PROJECT_TITLE`  
  To be used in summaries and release titles, e.g. `Team X Weekly Report`
- `ZULIP_BOT_EMAIL`  
  The e-mail address associated with your Zulip bot, e.g. `team-x-bot@balena.zulipchat.com`
- `ZULIP_BOT_NAME`  
  Arbitrary bot name (used to commit a fresh summary file), e.g. `TeamXBot`
- `ZULIP_ORGANIZATION_URL`  
  Most likely `https://balena.zulipchat.com`
- `ZULIP_PING`  
  Who to ping, e.g. `@*teamX*`, which is included in the Zulip reminder message
- `ZULIP_STREAM`  
  Stream name on Zulip, e.g. `aspect/teamX`
- `ZULIP_TOPIC`  
  Topic name on Zulip, e.g. `Team X - WDYD?`

### Secrets

Define these [secrets](https://docs.github.com/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets):
- `ZULIP_API_KEY`  
  The API key associated with your Zulip bot

### Schedules (optional)

Schedules are defined as CRON job GitHub action triggers.
By default:
- Reminders are triggered every Friday at 12.00PM UTC
- Publishing is triggered every Monday at 2.45PM UTC

These can be adjusted in [`remind.md`](./.github/workflows/remind.yml) and [`publish.md`](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) respectively.
